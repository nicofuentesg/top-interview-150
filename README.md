# 🚀 Top Interview 150  

Welcome to **Top Interview 150**, a personal challenge where I'll be solving one coding interview question per day from the **Top 150 most common interview problems**.  

The goal? To improve problem-solving skills, get comfortable with different data structures and algorithms, and (hopefully) optimize solutions along the way. Some might be the most efficient solutions, others will be a work in progress — but the idea is to keep learning and improving.  

## 📌 Plan  
- Solve **one problem per day** 🏆  
- Write a clear explanation for each solution ✍️  
- Refactor and optimize when possible ⚡  

## 🔍 Topics Covered  
✔ Arrays & Strings  
✔ Linked Lists  
✔ Stacks & Queues  
✔ Trees & Graphs  
✔ Recursion & Backtracking  
✔ Sorting & Searching  
✔ Dynamic Programming  
✔ Bit Manipulation  
✔ Math & Probability
